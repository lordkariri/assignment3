                    This project explores how students interact with Pagerob, my university’s mailroom system. 
                    By observing real users and conducting interviews, I identified key behaviors and challenges 
                    in the pickup process. From these insights, I developed two personas and storyboards that 
                    capture distinct user experiences, bringing their interactions with Pagerob to life.

                    <p>Pagerob is an automated university mailroom system that allows students to pick up their packages in an organized queue system. The process involves:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Swiping Student ID at Check-in Machine:</strong> Students arrive at the mailroom and swipe their student ID on a machine. A confirmation screen asks if they want to pick up their package.</li>
                        <li><strong>Waiting Area & Queue Display:</strong> The student’s name is added to a waitlist displayed on a TV screen. Students wait for their turn while the mailroom staff process packages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Name Called by Staff:</strong> A staff member manually calls the student’s name when their package is ready. The student approaches the pickup counter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Final Identity Confirmation & Signature:</strong> The student swipes their ID again at the counter to verify their identity. They pick up a pen and physically sign their name to confirm receipt. The package is handed over.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Key Observations from User Interactions</h3>
                    <p><strong>Person 1:</strong> Entered Pagerob at a relaxed pace, took her time at the kiosk, briefly checked the queue screen, and then got distracted by a conversation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Person 2:</strong> Rushed into Pagerob, focused on her phone, avoiding eye contact. She swiped her ID multiple times at the kiosk without noticing the warning sign.</p>
                    <p><strong>Person 3:</strong> Walked in with purpose, swiped his ID once, and took a moment to read the confirmation screen before continuing.</p>
    
                    <h3>General Patterns Observed:</h3>
                    <p>Users varied in their approach—some multitasked or got distracted while waiting, while others prioritized efficiency. Careful reading of instructions versus rushing through them affected how smoothly the process went.</p>

                        <p class="question"><strong>(1) How did you first learn to use Pagerob? Was the process intuitive, or did you need help?</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Person 1:</strong> “I think I just figured it out? I remember seeing people swipe their ID, so I did the same thing.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Person 2:</strong> “I mean, it’s not that complicated. You swipe, you wait, they call you. I didn’t really think about it.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Person 3:</strong> “I read the instructions on the screen the first time. It seemed pretty straightforward to me.”</p>

                        <p><strong>Person 2:</strong> “I swiped my card—like, a few times, because nothing seemed to happen at first. Then I sat and waited. I was on my phone the whole time, so I just listened for my name.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Person 3:</strong> “Swiped my ID, read the confirmation, checked the screen to see my place in line. I waited for a bit, and when my name popped up, I went up right away.”</p>

                        <p><strong>Person 2:</strong> “Yeah, I guess I didn’t notice the thing about swiping once, so that pushed my name down or something? Kind of annoying.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Person 3:</strong> “No, I mean, I wasn’t in a rush, but it seemed like a normal amount of time.”</p>

            Using insights from my observations and interviews, I developed two personas that represent 
            distinct user experiences at Pagerob. Each persona is based on common behaviors and challenges 
            identified in the pickup process. To bring these personas to life, I created empathy maps 
            that illustrate their thoughts, feelings, actions, and interactions with the system.
